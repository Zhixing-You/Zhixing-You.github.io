Hi! I am Zhixing You (游志兴), a postdoctoral research fellow in mathematics at Einstein Institute of Mathematics, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. My research interests lie in set theory and mathematical logic, with a focus on large cardinals, forcing, and Suslin trees.

I received my Ph.D. in mathematics from the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2016-2022), with a joint program at the University of Barcelona (2020-2021). My advisors were Joan Bagaria, Liuzhen Wu, and Jiachen Yuan. I also hold a B.G.S. in Mathematics and Biology from Nankai University (2012-2016).

Currently, I work as a postdoctoral researcher at Einstein Institute of Mathematics, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem under the supervision of Yair Hayut, where I continue my research in set theory.
